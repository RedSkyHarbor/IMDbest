## Design Points
This repo contains two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and therefore two places to run `npm` commands

  1. [**Node server**](server.js): [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * generated by `npm init` 
  2. [**React UI**](client/): [`client/package.json`](client/package.json)
      * generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
