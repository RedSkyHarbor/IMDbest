## Built with

[React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front end library

[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Simplifies input validation with forms

[Typescript](typescriptlang.org) - JS superset with type checking

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - Component library that utilizes inclusive design

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node library

[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Deployed

## Design Points

This repo contains two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and therefore two places to run `npm` commands

1. [**Node server**](server.js): [`./package.json`](package.json)
   - generated by `npm init`
2. [**React UI**](client/): [`client/package.json`](client/package.json)
   - generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
